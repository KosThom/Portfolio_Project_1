# Data Cleaning using SQL
In this project my goal is to do some data cleaning using SQL on a housing dataset (almost 56000 rows).
In the end less than half of the original data remains (almost 25000 rows).
The bad data are stored in a Temp table. So in case some missing data become available in the future
they could be added back in.
